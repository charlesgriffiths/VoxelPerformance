Thank you for trying Voxel Performance for Unity. Voxel Performance is a simple, high-performance asset that may be used to create and manipulate voxel based terrain or other large voxel structures. This asset uses a combination of compute shaders and a geometry shader to create map chunks with Perlin Noise and display them quickly. Chunks may also be extracted from the compute shaders as an array of raw voxel data, an array of Unity Mesh, or a Unity TerrainData.
